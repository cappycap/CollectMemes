It's important that when users first register, they are brought through an onboarding process. 

I want to redesign welcome.json with a fun character that welcomes users, and asks whether or not they want to sign in or sign up.
"Hi, my name is Memey, the CollectMemes diamond!" Eyes open, big smile.
"Welcome to the app! Is this your first time, or do you want to sign in?" Eyes closed, cute smile.

Sign up:
Memey says "Let's begin by choosing a username, which will show up on the Leaderboard and be used to identify you to others. Pick something unique!"

Be sure to put text under email: "In case you forget your password!"

Register success: 
Memey standing central, says "Nice, you're all set up, {{username}}! Just for you, I'm going to cover the basics of the app."

Memey disappears, highlight certain parts of the main page -

"These are the Spin and Collect buttons."
"Use the Spin to discover new memes, and Collect to add your favorites to your Vault. You get 10 spins and 1 collect per hour."
"You don't need to collect every meme you love! Use the Like button to save memes you don't want to affect your average rank."

"Tap here to view your Vault."

"Tap here to view the leaderboard, challenges, achievements, and more!"

"Lastly, tap here to add friends, view your level, and manage your account!"
