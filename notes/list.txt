^ similar to "members" example on templates

on load:

	if (!firstLoadDone) :

	  {{ set by reg: firstLoadDone, spinsLeft }}
	  {{ set by login: 
	  - collectstatus = 1, spinStatus = 1, populate new current, nextSpin == now - 1, firstLoadDone = 1, populate currentSpinMessage, set liked = 0

	else :

		if (collectStatus == 1) :

		  - render view

		elseif (collectStatus == 0)

		 1. network request for currentTime
		 2. if (currentTime > nextSpin) :

		  - user has waited long enough and collectStatus should be 1.
		  - collectStatus == 1, populate a new current, update currentSpinMessage, render view, set liked = 0

		3. else :
		  - create timer with interval = to time left until spin
			+ action to execute is update cache, set liked = 0
			  - on success refresh

	in html:
	- javascript to generate rank info from php page when meme's rank is provided.

	in template:
	- if (spinsLeft > 0)
	- allow spin button to be used, else not
	- if (collectStatus == 1)
	- allow collect button to be used, else not
	- if (spinsLeft == 0)
	- display javascript timer

on spin:
	- minus spinsLeft by 1, grab new meme for next iteration, update currentSpinMessage, set liked = 0
	- if spinsLeft == 0, set spinStatus to 0, set nextSpin to now + 900
	- refresh view

on collect:
	- set collectStatus == 0, spinStatus == 0, nextSpin == currentTime + 900
	- add meme to user's collection
	- update meme's collects and likes by 1
	- maybe a util alert or something else saying congrats youve collected a meme, etc.
