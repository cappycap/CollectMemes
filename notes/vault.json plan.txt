- vault.json continually keeps track of a number (cur) that represents the beginning of the current page
	+ cur starts at 1

- if cur + 9 < collectionSize, display right arrow

- if cur !== 1, display left arrow

- changing to a different sorting method resets cur. sorting method controlled through

I need to restructure database!

It's not feasible to have a string of user's collection for fetching from vault.
Instead, I need to create an 'owners' column within memes table, then for vault I can:

oCalc is the necessary column value to carry out sort supplied by client

SELECT memeId FROM owns WHERE userId=2 ORDER by rank ASC LIMIT 9 OFFSET 1

getMemeById not utilized in vault!

do this instead: 

owns table
id | userId | memeId | dateAdded | rank
