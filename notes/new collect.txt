#isMeme is for controlling the appearance of: rank section, author
#title, image, rarityLining are set to a spin to get started variant if user cant spin

NOTE: params.call must be passed from login/register.

on load:
- if params.call, make call to getMeme. this will either return a new meme, spin to get started, or out of spins info. 
- set cache and render.

in template:
- if statement controlling appearance of rank section and author based on isMeme. isMeme is 0 for out of spins/spin to start.
- if statement for isLiked for which heart to display
- if statement for whether or not to have action on buttons based on collectStatus and spinStatus

on spin:
- href to collect with params.call = 1

on collect:
- make call to addToCollection (which updates spinsLeft:0, nextSpin:appropriate<-(compare whether or not nextSpin has been updated by running out of spins already. if it has, don't update it.) in DB) - add a check in aTC for whether meme is already in user's shit to handle multiple clicks.
- memeCollected template appears, that has href to collect with params.call = 1
