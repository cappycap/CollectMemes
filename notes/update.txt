when it comes to updates, i should have a variable called loggedIn for every user, that is set to 1 on acct creation/login, and is checked for on the collect page.
this way, i can set everyone's loggedIn to 0 to force them to logout and set firstLoadDone to 0.

implement checking for the db's lastNextSpin and lastSpinsLeft on login
- checkUser returns the db's value. 
- need to have collect handle collecting nextSpin (isnt it a cache var?) might want to make it global, and just set it on the network request to check user ret.
